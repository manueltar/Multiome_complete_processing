# We are using the following datasets to generate the pkl models:

“Robust temporal map of human in vitro myelopoiesis using single-cell genomics” Alsinet et al, Nature communications, 2022

“Blood and immune development in human fetal bone marrow and Down syndrome” Jardine et al, Nature, 2021

# To see how to create a pkl model:

# To run CellTypist with already generated models (.plk files) see:. They have their own conda environment (see Dependencies/CellTypist.yml)
